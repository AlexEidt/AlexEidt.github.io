Q = 199, 1237

P = 199, 1237 + 2*427

R = 199 + 4*618, 1237

S = 199 + 4*618, 1237 + 2*427

QPRS encompasses an area of the background image. The following instructions
pertain only to the least significant bit of every pixel in the red channel of this area.

1 => Least Significant Bits
8 => Most Significant Bits

Each area can be considered a bit mask. Combined them as shown below.
There are 8 layers. The final result is a byte array.
