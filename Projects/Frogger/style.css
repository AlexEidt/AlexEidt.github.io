Q = 199, 1237

P = 199, 1237 + 2*427

R = 199 + 4*618, 1237

S = 199 + 4*618, 1237 + 2*427

1 => Least Significant Bits
8 => Most Significant Bits

Stack them up and get a byte array!

(1 << 0 | 2 << 1 | 3 << 2 | 4 << 3 | 5 << 4 | 6 << 5 | 7 << 6 | 8 << 7).jpg

First byte of the data:
    Has its LSB in area 1.
    Has the next bit in area 2.
    ...
    Has its MSB in area 8.
